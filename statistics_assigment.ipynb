    "# Measures of Variability:\n",
    "# Measures of variability quantify the spread, dispersion, or variation of data points. \n",
    "# They provide information about how the data is distributed around the central tendency measures.\n",
    "# Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. \n",
    "# It provides a simple measure of the spread of data but can be influenced by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variance: The variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean.\n",
    "# It quantifies the dispersion of data around the mean. A higher variance indicates greater variability in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. \n",
    "# It measures the average deviation of data points from the mean. \n",
    "# The standard deviation is widely used as it represents the spread of data in the same units as the original data,\n",
    "# making it easier to interpret."
